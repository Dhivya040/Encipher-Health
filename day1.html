    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Dhivya. I am passionate about technology and enjoy learning new skills that help me build creative projects. I love exploring web development, coding, and design. Learning HTML is my first step toward building creative and functional websites. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting with design, and sharing my ideas online. 
    My goal is to grow into a developer who can craft digital experiences that are both 
    simple and impactful.</p>
