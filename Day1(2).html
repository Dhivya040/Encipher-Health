    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Why I'm excited to learn HTML</h1>
    <p>Learning HTML feels like unlocking the secret language of the web. Every button I click, every article I read, and every image I scroll past is built on this foundation. By understanding HTML, I’m not just consuming the internet I’m learning how to shape it, to craft my own digital spaces where ideas can live and breathe.</p>
    <p>HTML is static, yet powerful. It’s like the blueprint of a house: simple lines and structures that give shape to something much bigger. With just a few tags, I can create order out of chaos, turning raw text into a page that speaks clearly. It’s creative in its simplicity, and mastering it means I can build without needing anything fancy at first.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, learning HTML is my first step toward independence in the digital world. Instead of relying on templates or tools, I gain the ability to write my own code, to design my own layouts, and to express myself freely. It’s the static canvas where creativity begins, and once I master it, the possibilities expand endlessly.</p>
